## About  
This is an antivirus interface. The current functionalities are limited to matching file names. Any type of signature based or heuristic analysis would need to be implemented in the program.  
  
## How to run the program  
Start Qt in administrator mode by right clicking your Qt shortcut/icon and select run as administrator. You will most likely get a permissions error in the console and the program will not run if you do not start Qt with administrator privileges. Select File->Open FIle or Project.. and navigate to the GenomeAntivirus.pro file. The program should run now.
